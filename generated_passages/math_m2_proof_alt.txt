This image is a snapshot of a mathematical theorem along with its proof. The theorem is labeled as Theorem 11 and begins by stating conditions involving a set ùí± being closed under non-negative scaling, disjoint union, and item truncation. It mentions the terms query-sufficient, MDDMP(ùí±), value oracles, and ODP input, referring to some algorithms and mathematical models. The theorem is split into two key properties - one concerning the quality of the ODP input mentioning (Œ± ‚àí 1/(2k‚àí2))-approximation and the other discussing the complexity and approximation bound involving polynomial equations. A proof follows the theorem which emphasizes combining various pieces together, taking into account valuations, subsets, algorithm input and output sufficiency, instances, and compatibility conditions. The proof also references other previously mentioned lemmas and corollaries which contribute to its conclusion. The text appears to be from an academic paper or textbook focused on algorithms, optimizations, and complexities.
