This image shows a page from a research paper titled "Rewriting the Script: Adapting Text Instructions for Voice Interaction" presented at DIS '23, held in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. The page features a table labeled "Table 3: HCI Goals and relevant work from NLP." The table helps to connect Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) goals to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It lists eight HCI goals in the first column, descriptions of those goals in the second column, related NLP tasks in the third column, and selected research in the fourth column. The goals mentioned are: 'Rewrite,' 'Summarize,' 'Signpost,' 'Split,' 'Elaborate,' 'Volunteer,' 'Reorder,' and 'Redistribute'. Below the table, there is a brief section titled "5.4 Futures with Voice Assistants that Rewrite the Script." This section discusses what can be accomplished with current advances in natural language processing and the potential of voice assistants that can adapt instructions for users. The page includes text and a table with no images or diagrams.
