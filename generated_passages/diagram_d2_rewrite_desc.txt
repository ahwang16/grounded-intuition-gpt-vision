"Certainly. The figure provided is a visual comparison of a traditional recipe script and a rewritten script that has been improved to be more efficient and useful. The figure is divided into two main sections; on the left is the original script, and on the right is the rewritten script. Additionally, the rewritten section features tags that highlight the improvements made.

On the left side, there is an example of a traditional recipe card for Tuscan Butter Salmon. The title is at the top, followed by the list of ingredients below it, which includes Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, 3 tablespoons of butter, 3 cloves of garlic minced, 1 and a ½ cups of halved cherry tomatoes, and 2 cups of baby spinach. Under the ingredients, there is a single, long paragraph that serves as Step 2 of the recipe. The paragraph mentions the steps to reduce heat, add butter, stir in garlic and cook it, add cherry tomatoes, season, and finally add spinach.

Now, the right half of the figure shows the rewritten version of the script split into smaller, easier-to-follow chunks. The first box on the right side summarizes what will be done, stating, ""Step 2. Next, you will cook the tomatoes and spinach with simple seasonings. Be ready to reduce the heat right after this step."" There are also words like “summarize” and “signpost” beside this box, indicating the changes made.

Then, there are separate boxes for each step, like chopping tomatoes and mincing garlic, reducing heat and adding butter, adding tomatoes and seasoning, and finally adding spinach. These boxes are labeled with tags such as “reorder”, “redistribute”, “split”, “elaborate”, and “volunteer”. To the bottom right, there is also an image of spinach, tagged as “visualize”, which is intended to give a visual reference for that ingredient.

In summary, the image is depicting that by breaking step 2 of a recipe into sub-steps, making it more instructive, and providing visual aids, this rewritten script becomes more intuitive and easier for the user to follow compared to the original script."
