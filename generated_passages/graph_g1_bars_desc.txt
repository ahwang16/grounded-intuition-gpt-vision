"Certainly! This figure is a set of three bar graphs side by side, each representing different categories of text - (a) News, (b) Speeches, and (c) Stories. The graphs are comparing the average number of occurrences of named entities and novel named entities in sentences that belong to one of four groups: human-written, machine-generated, never selected by a player, or selected by one or more players.

Along the vertical axis, we have the average number of occurrences, which ranges from 0 to 2.5. The horizontal axis represents two types of entities - named entity and novel named entity. In each graph, these entity types have four bars associated with them, each bar representing one of the sentence groups I just mentioned: human-written, machine-generated, never selected by a player, or selected by one or more players.

The bars are colored differently. Human-written sentences are represented with a light blue color, machine-generated sentences are shown in dark red, sentences that were never selected by a player are in blue, and sentences that were selected by one or more players are in a pinkish-brown color.

For the first graph labeled (a) News:
- Named entities have roughly 2.0 occurrences on average in human-written sentences, about 1.5 in machine-generated, nearly 1.6 in those never selected by a player, and around 1.9 in sentences selected by one or more players. 
- Novel named entities are somewhat lower, with averages between 0.8 and 1.1 for all groups.

In the second graph labeled (b) Speeches:
- Named entities have an average of around 1.5 occurrences in human-written sentences, close to 1.1 in machine-generated, approximately 1.3 in sentences never selected by a player, and just over 1.4 in sentences selected by one or more players.
- Novel named entities have fewer averages ranging from around 0.3 to 0.8.

In the third graph labeled (c) Stories:
- Named entities have just over 1.0 occurrences on average in human-written sentences, approximately 1.5 in machine-generated, close to 1.2 in sentences never selected by a player, and around 1.3 in sentences selected by one or more players.
- Novel named entities are lower with averages between 0.6 and 0.9.

So, in summary, this figure shows bar graphs comparing the average occurrences of named and novel named entities in four groups of sentences across news, speeches, and stories."
