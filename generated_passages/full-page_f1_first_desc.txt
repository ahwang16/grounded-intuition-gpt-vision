This page appears to be the first page of a research paper. The paper is titled "Rewriting the Script: Adapting Text Instructions for Voice Interaction". There are four authors listed; Alyssa Hwang from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, PA, USA, Natasha Oza also from the University of Pennsylvania, Chris Callison-Burch also from the University of Pennsylvania, and Andrew Head from the University of Pennsylvania as well. There are two columns on the page, with the left column being more text-heavy.

The left column starts with an abstract. The abstract explains that voice assistants have become increasingly popular but their use has been mostly limited to simple interactions like music, hands-free search, or control of the internet-of-things devices. The paper seems to explore how voice assistants can be adapted to guide people through more complex tasks, taking recipes as an example. The authors discuss the current state of the art in voice assistants and their limitations, and suggest how we can enable them to communicate effectively with users for more complex tasks.

The left column then lists "CCS CONCEPTS", which look like categories that the article might belong to, and is followed by one entry that reads  "•Human-centered computing→Interactive systems and tools." After that, there is a section with "KEYWORDS" which are descriptive tags for the paper. These include “voice assistants, instructions, voice user interfaces, remixing, complex task guidance, summarization, splitting, reordering”.

The left column concludes with an acknowledgment that includes a small bloc of text in a smaller font size, which seems to cite ACS Style conventions.

Now, shifting our focus to the right column. It starts with a section titled "1 INTRODUCTION". This section discusses how voice assistants have moved from being a science fiction element to an everyday reality and gives insight into how they have evolved to be used in cases of growing complexity. However, they’re not yet adept at helping with certain specific complex tasks. The authors specifically mentioned recipes and cooking as an example, and based on what is shown on this page, they aim to shed light on both the limitations and possibilities of voice assistants when it comes to complex guidance and their interaction with users.

At the bottom of the page, there's a page number 2233, which indicates that this page is probably part of a larger document or publication. The article is set in a usual academic two-column format, with standard fonts, and uses scholarly language.
