Alt text: A table displaying performance metrics of three different methods, namely 'Intersection', 'Union', and 'Refined method', across four varying corpus sizes (0.5K, 8K, 128K, and 1470K). For each method and corpus size, three performance metrics are presented: Precision (percentage), Recall (percentage), and AER (Alignment Error Rate). The table shows that as corpus size increases, Precision and Recall generally improve, while AER decreases for all methods. The 'Refined method' has the lowest AER, especially with larger corpus sizes.
