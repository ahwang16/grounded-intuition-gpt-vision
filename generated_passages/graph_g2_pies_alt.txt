This figure contains eight circular charts representing the error distribution in different natural language processing models and a human. The categories of error include grammar, repetition, irrelevant content, contradictions, common sense coherence, reference, generic responses, and others. The eight models/human responses compared are GPT2-XL with varying parameters p set to 0, 0.4, and 1.0, GPT2, GPT2-XL Fine-tuned, Human, CTRL with a focus on Politics, CTRL with Random information, and Random responses. GPT2-XL (p=1.0) and Random charts show a predominance of grammar errors while Human, and some fine-tuned models exhibit a more balanced error distribution. The charts use different colors to distinguish between error types and provide percentage values for each category.
