Alt text: This is a table comparing the performance of various models based on different training schemes and sizes of training corpora. The table has seven rows including the title row and five columns. The columns represent "Model", "Training scheme", and the sizes of training corpus "0.5K", "2K", "8K", and "34K". There are six models labeled Model 1 through Model 6 along with two other comparisons labeled "Dice" and "Dice+C". The "Training scheme" column contains mathematical expressions representing the scheme used for different models. The remaining three columns contain numerical values representing the performance of each model with varying sizes of training corpora. The values in these columns generally decrease as the size of the training corpus increases, indicating improved performance with more data.
