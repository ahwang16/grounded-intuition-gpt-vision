This page features a combination of text and images from an academic research paper titled "Rewriting the Script: Adapting Text Instructions for Voice Interaction" presented at the DIS 23, July 10-14, 2023, in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. The top half of the page displays a labeled image titled 'Figure 3: Completed dishes'. The image contains photographs of 10 different dishes in small frames arranged in two rows. Each frame has a label indicating the name of the dish. The dishes seem varied in content and origin, including "Steaks with Blue Cheese Butter (C1)", "Eggless Red Velvet Cake (C2)", "Sesame Pork Milanese (C3)", "Honey Garlic Chicken Wings (C4)", "Teriyaki Salmon (C5)", "Seafood Marinara (C6)", "Honey Soy Glazed Salmon (C7)", "Sausage and Veggie Quiche (C8)", "Egg Biriyani (C9)", "Lebanese Chicken Fatteh (C10)", "Herb Roasted Salmon with Tomato Avocado Salsa (C11)", and "Ground Beef Bulgogi (C12)".

The text content of the page begins below the image and is divided into three sections. '3.4 Analysis' discusses the types of data (audio and video recordings, researcher notes, etc.) used in the study and how it was analyzed. '4 Results' gives an overview of the interactions participants had with a voice assistant while following recipes, referring to participants as “cooks.” The right-hand side of the page contains a '4.1 Overview' subsection which reveals insights from the study regarding the range of recipes participants interacted with. Here, discussion revolves around the familiarity, complexity, length, and cultural origin of recipes and how participants navigated these aspects.

The page seems to be part of a research study that investigates how cooks prepared a variety of dishes with the assistance of a voice assistant, and how they interacted with and navigated the instructions provided to them.
