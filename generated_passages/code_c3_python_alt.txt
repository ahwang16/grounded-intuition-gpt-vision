This image contains a screenshot of Python code which defines a class named "LlamaEngine" that inherits from "HuggingEngine". The code has three methods: "__init__", "build_prompt", and "message_len". The "__init__" method takes several parameters including the model string and various optional arguments to initialize the base class "HuggingEngine". The "build_prompt" method is meant for building and tokenizing a prompt from a user-assistant conversation, using incoming messages and functions. It accepts messages and functions as parameters and appends tokens to build a prompt. Finally, the "message_len" method calculates the length of a message. The code seems to be part of a larger project possibly for a chatbot as it uses tokens to manage chat messages.
