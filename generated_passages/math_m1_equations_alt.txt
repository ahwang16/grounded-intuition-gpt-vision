"Image of a section from a technical article titled 'Decoder: General Description'. The text discusses a new model architecture where each conditional probability is defined by Equation 2. The probability depends on a distinct context vector 'c' for each target word. The context vector is computed by an RNN and relies on a sequence of annotations, with each annotation containing information about the whole input sequence with a focus on the surrounding parts of a specific word. The text also contains mathematical equations representing the concept."
