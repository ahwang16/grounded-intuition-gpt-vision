"Certainly, I will describe the figure in detail for someone who cannot see it.

The figure is a line graph that depicts how the accuracy of language models changes with the number of examples in context, as well as how their accuracy varies depending on the size of the model and the presence of a natural language prompt.

The x-axis, or horizontal axis, is labeled ""Number of Examples in Context (K)"" and it has a logarithmic scale, starting at 10^0 and increasing to 10^1. This axis represents the number of examples the model is given in context to learn from.

The y-axis, or vertical axis, is labeled “Accuracy (%)” and has a linear scale ranging from 0 to 60. This represents how accurately the language model is performing in percentage terms.

There are three groups of lines on the graph, each representing models with different parameter sizes: 1.3 billion (1.3B), 13 billion (13B), and 175 billion (175B).

Within each group, there are two lines – one solid and one dashed. The solid line represents the case where a natural language prompt is used, and the dashed line represents the case where there is no prompt. The 1.3B model is represented in green, the 13B model in orange, and the 175B model in blue.

At the top of the graph, there are also three annotations - ""Zero-shot"", ""One-shot"", and ""Few-shot"". These terms refer to different learning scenarios based on the number of examples provided to the model.

Now, let's analyze the changes.

1. For the 1.3B model with green lines, the solid line (with natural language prompt) and dashed line (without prompt) are both very close to each other and remain low, barely rising above 10% accuracy as the number of examples increases.

2. The 13B model with the orange lines shows a slight increase in accuracy as the number of examples increases. When a natural language prompt is used (solid line), the accuracy is slightly higher than when no prompt is used (dashed line).

3. The 175B model with blue lines shows the most noticeable improvement in accuracy as the number of examples increases. There is also a more significant gap between the solid (with prompt) and dashed (without prompt) lines in comparison to the other two models. The accuracy of the 175B model with a natural language prompt approaches 60% as the number of examples increases.

In summary, this graph illustrates that as the number of parameters in the language models increases, there is a noticeable improvement in accuracy, especially when a natural language prompt is utilized. The 175B parameter model outperforms the smaller models, with accuracy nearly reaching 60% as the number of examples provided increases."
