"This figure comprises a set of eight pie charts that seem to be comparing different versions of language models, including human responses, in terms of various error categories.

From the top left and moving in rows:
1. The first pie chart represents “GPT2-XL (p = 0.0)”.
2. Next to it is “GPT2-XL (p = 0.4)”.
3. The third in the top row is “GPT2-XL (p = 1.0)”.
4. The last one in the top row represents “Human”.

5. The first one in the second row is labeled “GPT2”.
6. Next to it is “GPT2-XL (Fine-tuned)”.
7. The third in the second row is “CTRL (Politics)”.
8. The final one in the second row is labeled “CTRL (Random)”.

9. Additionally, there is a ninth pie chart that is not arranged with the others, but instead, it is placed at the bottom right corner of the figure. It is labeled “Random”.

Each pie chart is divided into sections that represent different error categories, indicated by colors:

- Blue signifies grammar errors.
- Green is for repetitions.
- Purple is for irrelevance.
- Yellow represents contradictions with sentence context or knowledge.
- Light Purple represents commonsense and coherence errors.
- Orange is for coreference errors.
- Red is for generic errors.
- Gray represents other errors.

The percentage of each error is displayed in each section of the pie charts.

For illustration, the “GPT2-XL (p = 0.0)” has sections like 31% for red (generic errors), 12% for orange (coreference errors), and several other sections of different sizes and colors.

In contrast, the “Human” pie chart has a relatively large blue section constituting 31%, and much smaller sections for other categories.

The last pie chart labeled “Random” has a very dominant gray section covering 61% of the pie, and the rest of the pie is divided into much smaller sections with different colors. 

The pie charts seem to be a visual representation of how varying the parameters or versions of language models, and human responses, affect the kind and proportion of errors made in language generation or tasks."
