This image is a snapshot of a page that appears to be from a mathematics or computer science research document. It contains a theorem and a proof which are densely written in a formal, academic style. The text seems to be on the topic of algorithms, most likely relating to optimization or complexity theory.

The image starts with a bold header reading "Theorem 11." The theorem spans three sections:

1. A small introduction discussing the general case under consideration. This includes specific mathematical terminologies such as "non-negative scaling, disjoint union", and terms like "MMDPP(ÎŽ)" hinting at some kind of decision problem or process. There's mention of a query algorithm and its input taking certain forms.

2. Two bullet points elaborating the properties the theorem is aiming to establish. The first bullet point, labeled as "Quality", mentions that the output of an algorithm is an approximation within some bounds. The second bullet point, labeled as "Complexity", seems to discuss constraints related to the input's complexity and has a mathematical inequality involving k and m.

3. Lastly, there's the proof of the theorem. The section named "Proof" contains a rigorous explanation that utilizes various mathematical terms, references to other lemmas and corollaries. It gives the impression of employing different pieces and structures to arrive at a conclusion, ensuring that certain guarantees or conditions are met for the problem domain in focus.

The text of the page is written in a mathematical language which includes symbols, Greek letters, functions, variables, parentheses, and curly braces.

In a nutshell, this image seems to be a very technical and formal fragment of a research paper or a textbook related to computer algorithms or mathematical optimization, aimed at an audience with a deep understanding of these subjects.
