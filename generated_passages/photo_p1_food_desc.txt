Starting from the top left corner:

1. “Steaks with Blue Cheese Butter (C1)” shows a close-up of a succulent steak resting on a white plate. A dollop of blue cheese butter beautifully melts over the top of the steak which appears to be cooked to a perfect medium-rare.

2. Moving to the right, “Eggless Red Velvet Cake (C2)” is presented. This dish is beautifully plated on a gold square board. The cake is bright red and is topped with circular placements of white icing. The board is also decorated with red rose petals alongside the cake.

4. Beside it is “Honey Garlic Chicken Wings (C4)” which feature chicken wings coated in a glossy, sticky sauce in a white bowl. They look caramelized and have sesame seeds sprinkled over them.

5. Going further right, “Teriyaki Salmon (C5)” shows a delicious-looking piece of salmon which is glazed with teriyaki sauce. The salmon is seen lying on an aluminum foil, probably just taken out of the oven. It’s cooked with herbs and has a caramelized appearance.
