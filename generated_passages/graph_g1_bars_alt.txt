This bar graph displays the average number of occurrences of named entities and novel named entities in three different textual categories: news, speeches, and stories. Each category is represented by a separate grouping of six bars, labeled as (a) News, (b) Speeches, and (c) Stories. Within each group, the six bars illustrate the occurrences of named and novel named entities based on the following criteria: human-written, machine-generated, never selected by the player, and selected by one or more players. The x-axis is divided into named entity and novel named entity, while the y-axis represents the average number of occurrences ranging from 0 to 2.5. The bars are colored to delineate human-written (light pink), machine-generated (dark blue), never selected by players (gray), and selected by one or more players (light blue). It is evident that, generally, machine-generated content has a lower occurrence of named entities across all categories compared to human-written content. Additionally, the selected content exhibits varying occurrences of named entities across the three categories.
