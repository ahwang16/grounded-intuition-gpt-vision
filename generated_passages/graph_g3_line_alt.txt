Alt text: This figure is a line chart titled "Lambada" that shows the accuracy of language models on the Lambada dataset as a function of the number of parameters. The x-axis is labeled "Parameters in LM (Billions)" and ranges from 0.1B to 175B. The y-axis is labeled "Accuracy" and ranges from 0 to 90. There are three lines on the chart representing Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot (K=15) settings. The Zero-Shot line is blue with circle markers, One-shot is green with diamond markers, and Few-Shot is orange with circle markers. All three lines show an upward trend as the number of parameters increase, with Few-Shot having the highest accuracy, followed by One-Shot and Zero-Shot. There is also a gray dashed horizontal line at around 70, labeled "Zero-Shot SOTA", and another gray dashed horizontal line near the top, labeled "Human", indicating the human-level performance benchmark. The chart suggests that as the number of parameters in the language model increases, the accuracy improves, with Few-Shot getting closer to human-level performance.
