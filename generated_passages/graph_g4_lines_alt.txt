Alt text: This is a line chart showing the relationship between accuracy in percentage on the Y-axis and the number of examples in context, plotted on a logarithmic scale on the X-axis. There are three lines representing the performance of language models with different numbers of parameters: 175 billion parameters (represented by a solid blue line), 13 billion parameters (represented by a dashed orange line), and 1.3 billion parameters (represented by a dashed-dot green line). There are annotations identifying Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot learning. There are also two vertical dashed lines labeled "Natural Language Prompt" and "No Prompt". The 175 billion parameter model has the highest accuracy, reaching around 55%. The 13 billion parameter model follows with lower accuracy, while the 1.3 billion parameter model has the least accuracy, remaining below 10%. The chart illustrates that as the number of parameters increases, the accuracy improves, and also, increased examples in context leads to a performance improvement in Few-shot learning.
