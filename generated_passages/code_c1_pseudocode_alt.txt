Alt text: A pseudo code snippet for an algorithm titled 'Algorithm ONLINE MATCH'. It receives a scaling parameter 'γ' between 0 and 1, and online arrivals of agents as inputs. The algorithm starts by calculating the solution to 'LP-UB' and stores it in 'αxy'. Then, for each agent 'i' arriving at time 't' of a certain type 'y', and for each type 'x' in a random order, it checks if there's at least one unmatched agent 'j' of type 'x'. If so, agent 'i' is matched with 'j' with a calculated probability dependent on 'γ' and 'αxy'. The algorithm terminates after processing all agents.
